I&#8217;m currently looking for a position which is 100% remote. I intend to relocate to the west coast within 18-24 months, and I&#8217;d prefer not to have to change jobs when I do so.. In a nutshell, I&#8217;m really good at helping people understand very complex technology. Much of my experience has been with highly technical support positions.

I&#8217;ve dabbled with a number of technologies on the side, personally and professionally. I know how to set up a solid mailserver, I can deploy Asterisk to replace virtually any phone system and gain cutting edge features, I can set up webservers, with or without load balancing. Deploying and maintaining common web applications, like WordPress, Magento, Mediawiki, Gitlab, Ghost, and Discourse is not a problem.
