After just commenting on the IT World article <http://www.itworld.com/it-managementstrategy/281801/fedora-introduces-offline-updates> and still having a lot to say on the subject, it felt like time for a blog post.

This move by Fedora disappoints me, because it means reboots are somehow becoming acceptable. They aren&#8217;t, they never have been, and we must take pains to make sure they never are.

Linux came from a long cultural heritage of unix-like operating systems, which due to their history in time sharing environments, had taught their administrators reboots were virtually unthinkable. Indeed, rebooting to fix a problem was as much heresy as entering St. Peter&#8217;s Basilica during mass and performing a satanic ritual. It just wasn&#8217;t done.
  
The culture shifted though, a lot of users came in from the desktop and, particularly the Microsoft worlds. Instead of giving an unplanned reboot the same scrutiny as a space shuttle falling out of the sky, we just shrug it off. As a result, we&#8217;re on a path to losing the phenomenal stability of Linux.

You see, reboots don&#8217;t fix problems, they are an act of acquiescence to them &#8211; shrugging them off and making the problem go away for a little while because we don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s wrong or are too lazy to deal with them.

We have to remember that&#8217;s the Microsoft way, not the Linux way, and teach this generation of Linux administrators, developers, and users that reboots, at least as a troubleshooting step still are heresy, that problems should be solved, not merely discarded in the hopes they don&#8217;t come back again at an inconvenient time. In every single reboot, short of a kernel update, there is a bug to be found and filed. Every single one.
