_This is a document I wrote up as a player handout for a D&D group I ran several years ago. It was born out of frustration over game sessions where very little actually happened because of player&#8217;s short attention spans.Â  This was written under D&D 3.5, but is pretty generic and can be applied to many games. I&#8217;ve edited this a little bit so that it&#8217;s useful to both players and Dungeon Masters(DM)._

<span style="font-family: Arial Black;"><span style="font-size: xx-large;">Managing Time at the Table</span></span>

Player Handout

<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">Time management in D&D is a difficult proposition, but without it, a lot is taken away from the game. Players want their characters to advance. Slow play delays that advancement and can cause players to lose interest. This handout presents suggested ways for players and dungeon masters to keep the game focused without taking away from the fun of D&D.</span>

<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: large;"><b>Focus and Fun</b></span></span>

<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">There is a balance needed between focus and fun in a D&D campaign. You can achieve both, but it takes everyone at the table to make that happen. Losing focus altogether sometimes is fun, but if that happens all the time, the game grinds to a halt. As focus goes away, everything in the game takes longer, so the problem magnifies itself quickly.</span></span>

  * <span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Be aware of player focus and things that affect it. Downtime in the middle of a session to sort out game mechanics or argue rules questions takes away the focus of other players.</span></span>
  * <span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Table talk&#8217;s an essential part of the D&D experience, and one reason that the game is so fun, but table talk affects focus too, and if it gets out of hand, it means the difference between playing the game and ignoring the game.</span></span>

<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: large;"><b>Keep on top of initiative.</b></span></span>

<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">It&#8217;s both the DM&#8217;s job and the player&#8217;s job to be aware of the initiative order and their place(s) in it, so they can focus on the game when it&#8217;s their turn, and when it&#8217;s about to be their turn. An easy way to keep track of this is by knowing who is ahead of you and who&#8217;s behind you in the initiative order. Give the next person a heads up &#8220;Joe, you&#8217;ll be next&#8221; so that they can prepare their actions.</span></span>

<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: large;"><b>Use a whiteboard or other visual aid for initiative.</b></span></span>

I use a magnetic initiative board, but you can easily use a whiteboard or even a dry erase battle mat to keep track of initiative.

<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: large;"><b>Prepare references for complex spells and abilities.</b></span></span>

<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Page number references make it easier to find the exact details of how a particular spell or ability works, and these references can literally save hours of time over the course of a campaign. Plus, time that you spend looking stuff up is time that other players are losing focus. Losing focus means the game slows down even more.</span></span>

<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: large;"><b>Recap</b></span></span>

<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">At appropriate times, the players and the DM should give a recap of the events and action so far to build interest. Starting the session off with a recap of the previous session&#8217;s events sets the mood and gets everyone into the right frame of mind to play. Similarly, recapping at the end of a session keeps the events fresh in everyone&#8217;s minds and gives a chance to build excitement for the next sessions. Recapping&#8217;s also useful in the middle of a session to keep players aware of what&#8217;s going on.</span></span>

<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: large;"><b>Use the battle grid when it&#8217;s appropriate to do so.</b></span></span>

<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">If the combat situation is getting confusing, it&#8217;s a good time to bring out the battle map, or at least to get some sort of visual representation of the combat up and running. While this is primarily a DM responsibility, players shouldn&#8217;t hesitate to ask the DM for a map.</span></span>

<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: large;"><b>Be responsible about extra initiatives</b></span></span>

<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The more turns out of the initiative order you .take. the longer a combat round takes to resolve. Minions, hirelings, familiars, and the like add to the flavor of a class, but they also show down the game. Keep this in mind, and consider class options without these features, or at least make a special effort to manage all your turns efficiently if you can&#8217;t live without them. Work with your DM to find alternatives to extra initiative actions where appropriate.</span></span>

<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: large;"><b>Resolve Rules Disputes Quickly</b></span></span>

<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Find an answer and find it fast. When there is a rules question, players should try to find an answer quickly. If this takes more than a minute or two, the DM should make a ruling on the spot to keep the game moving, and then sort it out at the end of the session or at the next break.</span></span>

<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: large;"><b>Roll Dice Efficiently</b></span></span>

<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">When it can be done so, roll all the dice at once. An example would be rolling an attack and it&#8217;s damage at the same time. Do this whenever possible, but only when it&#8217;s unambiguous, and when there are no intermediary decisions to make that could be unfairly influenced by the results. (Example: If your character has an ability that allows them to reroll a missed attack once a day, it&#8217;s unfair to make that decision with the knowledge of what the damage will be, as you&#8217;d at least be tempted to only take the reroll if the damage roll was favorable.)</span></span>

<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Colored dice can be used to sort out multiple rolls of the same dice type, but make sure it&#8217;s clear which dice mean what!</span></span>

<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: large;"><b>Remember the length of a combat round.</b></span></span>

<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">There are 10 combat rounds to a minute. That&#8217;s 6 seconds per round. Keep that in mind when communicating between characters while you are &#8220;under initiative&#8221;. Talking is a free action, carrying on a conversation shouldn&#8217;t be. A player&#8217;s turn within that round actually takes up most of the round, and actions on different initiatives happen &#8220;almost&#8221; concurrently.</span></span>

**Bring out the stopwatch.**

When all else fails to keep combat turns flowing smoothly, adopt a stopwatch and a reasonable time limit (I suggest 2 minutes). If a player can&#8217;t determine what to do within a reasonable allotment of time, their character cannot either, and should be declared to be **delaying** &#8211; meaning they can act later in the round after another player at a new place in the initiative order.
