This is dirty politics at it&#8217;s worst, but it may likely be a blessing for the Democrats in the 2012 election year, as it&#8217;s exactly the sort of misguided and secretive damage control gone wrong that will allow the Republicans to be portrayed as against the interests of the middle class.

House democrats attempted a procedural move to get a floor vote on extensions to a payroll tax cut, and were curbed by Republicans, who responded by adjourning the house, and then quickly cutting the video feed from the chamber.

Now, to me, it should be very clear who the Republicans want to cut taxes for, and it&#8217;s not you and me&#8230;They couldn&#8217;t stand for taxes to be raised on upper income people, but they are sitting here letting them be raised on the poor and middle class?

From the article on ThinkProgress:

> During a quick pro-forma session of the House this morning, Republicans rebuffed a Democratic attempt to force an up-or-down vote on the Senate-passed payroll tax holiday extension, which Republicans have thus far refused to allow. Rep. Michael Fitzpatrick (R-PA), who was serving as the speaker pro-temp, ignored shouts of “Mr. Speaker!” from Democratic Whip Steny [&#8230;]
