I have a very simple idea for closing tax loopholes while getting corporations keep getting tax breaks.

Tie tax breaks to jobs created and maintained, with additional credit given for length of service and certain salary milestones, so that businesses are credited for their positive impact on the economy and on the tax base.

With each american worker on the payroll providing a sizable credit, it should be designed so that companies start with a high tax rate, but can easily reduce or eliminate their tax burden by providing STABLE, long term, and reasonable paying jobs to enough of the people that need them.

The beauty of this is that it would directly encourage companies to keep good jobs here, and the companies that get out of paying taxes under this approach are going to generate tax revenue indirectly through high employment, generally enough to ofset the lost taxes.

Thoughts?
