Fraudulent listings on job boards have become far too commonplace, and this situation is made worse by job boards which allow a prospective employer to post listings anonymously.

Job seekers take a risk with any personal information they provide in response to a job posting. Even providing basic contact information exposes them to risks including fraud, phishing, and identify theft.

With these risks, it is necessary that job seekers be provided the opportunity to independently evaluate whether a listing is posted in good faith by a legitimate company or not. Without sufficient information to make such a determination, it is not safe to respond to a listing.

In light of this, as a job seeker, I&#8217;m asking that online job boards reevaluate the appropriateness of anonymous postings. I believe the time for allowing such postings is long past, the risks to job seekers and potential for abuse being too great to allow companies to conceal their identities.

I realize that there are legitimate reasons for companies wanting to conceal their identity when listing a job &#8211; the company may not wish to inform an incumbent in the position that they are to be replaced, or the company may not want to field phone calls or have visits from job seekers regarding the position, however, these are small considerations in light of widespread fraud on job boards, and it is better that a company take a risk of unwanted phone calls than an individual take a risk of identity theft. Legitimate companies that still wish to protect their anonymity should strongly be encouraged to work through a reputable agency, as this is the only solution that can provide anonymity without enabling fraud.

In conclusion, I encourage job sites to stop allowing anonymous job postings now, and require that listings clearly identify the company responsible for the listing in order to help job seekers protect themselves from fraud. In the mean time, I urge all job seekers out there to simply ignore such listings &#8211; they are simply too likely to be scams.
