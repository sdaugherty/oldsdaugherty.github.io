These values originate from a variety of places in our culture, and even in our DNA.

      The most primitive, and also the most deeply rooted form of morality comes from our capacity for empathy — through our capacity to understand and share in the feelings of others, we recognize when our actions cause suffering to another, and that in turn causes us to suffer, so our nature is to refrain from those actions. Even without religion or societal cues, most human beings have enough of a sense of empathy to form a basic moral compass, and even when given a set of moral principles through our societal conditioning, empathy can still lead us to question those principles when they cause suffering to others.
    </p>
    
    <p id="ca70" class="graf--p graf-after--p">
      Another form of morality is as a system of learned beliefs of what is right or wrong — these combine the primitive moral value of not causing suffering with the value system of a culture — religion, cultural norms, and legal principles which are taught throughout childhood, and refined even through our adulthood.
    </p>
    
    <p id="c4f8" class="graf--p graf-after--p">
      Yet another source of morality is in our capacity for reason — or more properly, our system of ethics — informed by our empathy, cultural values, religions beliefs, and legal system, we extrapolate and rationalize what is right and wrong, and make relative judgements between alternatives when conflicts arise.
    </p>
    
    <p id="6055" class="graf--p graf-after--p">
      When our moral systems are violated, we are disgusted by those actions — if we ourselves acted immorally, we feel guilt and shame, and where someone else did, we feel fear and anger.
    </p>
    
    <p id="c31c" class="graf--p graf-after--p">
      In order to avoid these feelings, we can alter, or short circuit our moral systems with competing values, or we can try to avoid thinking about the moral implications of actions. The more distant we are from the immoral act, the easier it is to ignore.
    </p>
    
    <p id="e82f" class="graf--p graf-after--p">
      As it turns out, when we are most directly involved with an immoral act against another human being is when it is hardest to ignore our basic biological programming for morality — the desire to lessen the suffering of others.
    </p>
    
    <p id="f04a" class="graf--p graf-after--p">
      Or so it would seem. Unfortunately, our fears, anger, and prejudices are more powerful than the basic morality of empathy — if we are able to be convinced that someone is less than us, that we should either fear our differences or look down on them, then we are able to dehumanize them, and in doing so bypass most basic part of our moral compass.
    </p>
    
    <p id="48aa" class="graf--p graf-after--p">
      This is the worst kind of slippery slope, because once we have been able to do it to a “lesser” person, it becomes easier and easier to apply the same process — to think of anyone as a lesser person.
    </p>
    
    <p id="f9e0" class="graf--p graf-after--p">
      Racism, homophobia, class warfare, religious intolerance, bigotry, all of these things are instruments of marginalization and dehumanization through which otherwise “good” people are able to justify “evil” acts.
    </p>
    
    <p id="8cf4" class="graf--p graf-after--p">
      And this is where power comes into the picture. Initially, the ability to marginalize and dehumanize gives one a form of perceived power over others. And that is just the beginning. As the perception of power gives way to the reality of it, some people find themselves addicted to it and want more and more. On their way up, they realize marginalization and dehumanization don’t just give them the tools to justify their own actions, but they also give them the tools to manipulate other to their own ends.
    </p>
    
    <p id="05c2" class="graf--p graf-after--p">
      By preying on our fears to pit us against each other in furtherance of their own agenda, the morally bankrupt can in turn manipulate and corrupt our morality so that we see others as less than ourselves, and can ignore injustices against them, or even be manipulated into inflicting suffering on them ourselves.
    </p>
    
    <p id="dceb" class="graf--p graf-after--p">
      This line of thinking is even further reinforced by another reality — the marginalized are themselves the most likely to recognize this condition, and therefore, likely to be seen as a threat to power. So, yet another systematic injustice is perpetuated — those on the margins of society are taught to fear one another, so they are so preoccupied by their own hatreds that they do not band together.
    </p>
    
    <p id="2ca8" class="graf--p graf-after--p">
      This is the true extent of the danger of marginalization, by teaching people that others are “less than”, our basic moral compass is skewed — we are turned on each other, manipulated into being the oppressors until it is our turn to be the oppressed, and ultimately making us capable of the most horrific and gruesome acts ever imagined.
    </p>
    
    <p id="fb2b" class="graf--p graf-after--p">
      There are no “lesser people”. We must recognize the very idea of a “lesser person” is a sick fantasy started to justify inhumanity towards others, and continually perpetuated as a tool to manipulate us.
    </p>
    
    <p id="f58a" class="graf--p graf-after--p graf--last">
      Recognizing that this idea of “lesser people” as a profound moral hazard at the root of so much injustice in our society, it is our duty to defend against it — to teach tolerance, to challenge the very notion of “less than”, and to be ever vigilant against it in whatever form it may appear.
